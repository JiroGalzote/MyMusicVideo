<p><b>[Verse 1]</b><br><br>
Look at the stars<br>
Look how they shine for you<br>
And everything you do<br>
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along<br>
I wrote a song for you<br>
And all the things you do<br>
And it was called 'Yellow'<br>
So then I took my turn<br>
Oh, what a thing to have done<br>
And it was all yellow<br><br>
</p>

<p>
	<b>[Chorus]</b><br><br>
(Aah) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones<br>
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful<br>
(Aah) You know, you know I love you so<br>
You know I love you so<br><br>


</p>

<p>
	<b>[Verse 2]</b><br><br>
I swam across<br>
I jumped across for you<br>
Oh, what a thing to do<br>
'Cause you were all yellow<br>
I drew a line<br>
I drew a line for you<br>
Oh, what a thing to do<br>
And it was all yellow<br>
</p>

<p><b>[Chorus]</b><br><br>
(Aah) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones<br>
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful<br>
(Aah) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
For you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
</p>

<p><b>[Bridge]</b><br><br>
It's true<br>
Look how they shine for you<br>
Look how they shine for you<br>
Look how they shine for<br>
Look how they shine for you<br>
Look how they shine for you<br>
Look how they shine<br><br>
</p>

<p><b>[Outro]</b><br><br>
Look at the stars<br>
Look how they shine for you<br>
And all the things that you do<br>
